* Name and partners name(At most teams of 2 folks total)
  * Team member 1: John Ciolfi
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? ~25
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? TAs about index management, shaders.
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!

  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
  I enjoyed the freedom to get to do what I wanted. Having a bit more time between A6 and the final project could have been nice.
